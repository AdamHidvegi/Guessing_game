# Guessing_game
This terminal game is my very first python program, so if you find any bug or incorrect logic, please let me know.

About the game:
the user is able to create, read, update, delete any data using the CRUD functionalities.
There are two different modes available: single and multiplayer, each mode has four different levels (easy, medium, hard, very hard).
User can check global and personal statistics as well.
The program gets words and hints from a different file (words.csv), so the user is able to modify them in order to make the game a bit more personal with their own ideas.
If you are using your own words and hints, please make sure everything is fine by using the 4. option in the main menu.

If you'd like to keep the database and avoid creating a new player every single time, just comment two lines (31, 46) out so you can close the game and return later without losing your points and avatars.

I used python and SQLite for this application.
